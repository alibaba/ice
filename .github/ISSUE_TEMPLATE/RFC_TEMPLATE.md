# Summary 概述

Optional, brief explanation of the feature.

# Motivation 背景动机

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected
outcome?

# Basic example 基础示例

Optional, if the proposal involves a new or changed API, include a basic code example.
Omit this section if it's not applicable.

# Detailed design 方案设计

This is the bulk of the RFC. Explain the design in enough detail for somebody
familiar with React to understand, and for somebody familiar with the
implementation to implement. This should get into specifics and corner-cases,
and include examples of how the feature is used. Any new terminology should be
defined here.

# Unresolved questions 遗留问题

Optional, but suggested for first drafts. What parts of the design are still
TBD?
