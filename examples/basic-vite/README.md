I found out about Vite and I wanted to have a boilerplate for the technologies that I use. You can find more about these in the following links: [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Eslint](https://eslint.org/), [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), [Dollie](https://github.com/dolliejs/dollie-core).
