# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a quick list of common questions to get you started engaging with this project in
[our documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/common-questions.md)

## Add A Changeset

After you have completed a feature or fixed a bug, you need to do three things:

- Select which packages should be released
- Bump released packages version
- Write Changelog for the released packages

- Run the command line script `npm run changeset`
- Select the packages you want to include in the changeset using `↑` and `↓` to navigate to packages, and `space` to select a package. Hit enter when all desired packages are selected.
- You will be prompted to select a bump type for each selected package. Select an appropriate bump type for the changes made. See here for information on semver versioning
- Your final prompt will be to provide a message to go alongside the changeset. This will be written into the changelog when the next release occurs.

After that, you should commit changes to the remote repository.

```bash
$ git status
On branch test-3
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        .changeset/curvy-jobs-fly.md

$ git commit -am "chore: add changeset"

$ git push
```

For more detail, please see [this documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/adding-a-changeset.md).

## Publish Beta Version

> NOTE: You must add a changeset first before publishing beta version.

Run the following commands to publish the beta version

```bash
# Enter the prerelese mode and generate the pre.json.
$ npm run release:beta
# Update to the beta version.
$ npm run changeset:version
# Publish the beta version to the npm.
$ npm run changeset:publish
# Exit the prerelese mode.
$ npm run release:exit
```

Then, we need to commit changes to the remote repository.

```bash
$ git status
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   packages/a/CHANGELOG.md
        modified:   packages/a/package.json
        modified:   pnpm-workspace.yaml

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        .changeset/pre.json

$ git commit -am "chore: beta version"

$ git push
```

For more detail, please see this [documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/prereleases.md).

## Publish Latest Version

GitHub bot will automatically create a PR to update the latest versions for the released package.

What we need to do is merge the PR to the `release*` branch.
